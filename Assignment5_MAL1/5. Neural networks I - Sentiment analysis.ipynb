      "  birth of the beatles   for being a us television movie  released in the fall of     has actually been  so far the best movie which tells the tale of the the four lads from liverpool that revolutionized the music industry and the world . as told by the point of view of former beatle pete best . the performance from the entire cast is excellent but  most especially the performance by stephen mackenna as john lennon and rod culbertson as paul mccartney . the film was produced by a legend of the rock and roll era  mr dick clark . who a year earlier in     had produced another tv movie  that has stood the test of time starring  kurt rusell  in the lead role about another musical legend  elvis  . that movie was directed by an unknown director named  john carpenter  who went on to direct other successful movies such as  halloween    escape from new york   and  the thing  . the same can be said for the director of the  birth of the beatles   mr richard marquand . he went on to direct other theatrical blockbusters such as  star wars return of the jedi    eye of the needle   and  jagged edge  among many . the only other film that tells the story of the fab four that i know of  is back beat which had a theatrical release in     . however  the critics did not care for it  nor did the public  for it did not have a long life span in the theater . birth of the beatles is very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles  hardships they went thru and ends at there pinnacle of success when they arrive in nyc and appear in the ed sullivan show in     . i highly recommend this film .  \n",
